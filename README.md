# Camera-Callibration

Estimating the K matrix using the widely used Zhang’s method(Zhang. Z, ”A
flexible new technique for camera calibration”, PAMI, 2000 ) covered in this course (calibration slide: 53-81). This
method relies on planar checkerboards to easily establish 3D-2D correspondences and then solves for the planar
homographies to factor out the K matrix.

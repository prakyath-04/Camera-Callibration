# Camera-Callibration

- Estimating the K matrix using the widely used Zhang’s method(Zhang. Z, ”A
flexible new technique for camera calibration”, PAMI, 2000 ) covered in this course (calibration slide: 53-81). This
method relies on planar checkerboards to easily establish 3D-2D correspondences and then solves for the planar
homographies to factor out the K matrix.

- Run the main_script.m to obtain the camera parameters of the camera used to take the photos in the 'image' folder.
